# README template

- [Quick Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- To give you an idea of how to spruce up your project `README`s, it should include **at least** the following in this order:


## `PREBUILD`

#### A. Name of your app / project

#### B. Brief Summary:

- Your projects's purpose/functionality.
- The motivation behind your idea.

#### C. Software Used:

- e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, axios, etc.
- List the APIS your project is consuming.

#### D. Wireframes

- Sketches: `canDraw ? do(it) : do(not)`
- Digital: [Google Drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/) (Free), [Wireframes.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) (Free), [MockFlow](https://www.mockflow.com/) (Free Trial), [MockPlus](https://www.mockplus.com/) (Free Trial)

#### E. Minimum Viable Product:

- List the funtionalities and features of your `MVP`.

#### F. External Resources

- List all resources used (articles/videos/stack overflow/etc)
- Here is where you protect yourself from plagiarizing claims!

## `POST-BUILD`

- Add a link of your deployed project in your summary.
- Add screenshots/gifs of your project running in the browser.
- Add screenshots of code snippets to highlight what you're most proud of, or most challenged by.
- Add a list of `post-MVP` features that you're waiting to add-on.
