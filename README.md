# README

#### A. Name of your app / project

- My portfolio website

#### B. Brief Summary:

- My portfolio website is what I can share with potential employers to showcase my skills. Not only will I have designed and coded the site, it will also include projects that they can reference for more examples of my work. I will continue to update the site as the course continues with new projects and incorporating new skills I learn.
- I wanted this site to be very simple and clean

#### C. Software Used/Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Google sheets
- Formspree
- Fetch
- APIs- from my google sheet

#### D. Wireframes

- Sketches: https://res.cloudinary.com/jeslan/image/upload/v1565492988/Project%201/IMG_4966_otvolg.jpg

#### E. Minimum Viable Product:

- The minimum viable product was the project requirements.

#### F. External Resources

- Bootstrap- nav bar, carousel, scrollspy
- Stack overflow
- Joe's codepen for the project cards
- Formspree instructions for form

#### G. Your Process and Approach

- First, I thought a little bit about what I wanted my site to look like, ensuring I looked at the project requirements
- Next, I drew out wireframes for both mobile and desktop. I went section by section and switched between mobile and desktop
- Then, I shared it with my instructor for feedback
- Now that I had the content, I began strategizing what the html should be- what should be divs and where do I need wrappers. This was a super helpful approach to ensure I planned my html according to the type of formatting I desired
- Then, I dove into the code. I laid out the skeleton of the site- using background colors to ensure all my divs were formatting correctly.
- Next, I went section by section and started to populate the content.
- When creating the 2 most complex features- the carousel and the cards- I first built simple ones using dummy data to ensure the functionality worked. Once I proved that the functionality worked, I then populated it with my content.
- I saved most of the CSS styling for last. Once everything worked, I went back and decided on fonts, colors, etc

#### G. Unsolved Problems

- I successfully was able to implement everything on the project requirements
- The one feature that I think I can improve is the carousel. While it is responsive, when it gets to ~400 px, it becomes clunky. The description I added to each photo disappears and the photos were cut off. I added a media query to help address the photos being cut off (setting the width to 100%) but it still is clunky as each photo has a different corresponding height now. Moving forward, I would probably remove the carousel and just stack the images for widths <400px

#### G. Biggest Wins and Challenges

- Biggest win was that each section of the site is 100% of the window (and responsive). This is one of my pet peeves when visiting sites- when I have to scroll to see the whole group of content. This is something I am definitely going to use again moving forward
- The biggest challenge was for sure the carousel!!! Specifically, getting the photos to look good. I wanted them to be full window but this was challenging as it cut the photos in weird areas.

## `POST-BUILD`

- Link of your deployed project in your summary: https://jessicalandzberg.github.io/Unit_1_Project/

http://ritzy-education.surge.sh/

- Add screenshots of code snippets to highlight what you're most proud of, or most challenged by.

    - I am most proud of the render function for my cards : https://res.cloudinary.com/jeslan/image/upload/v1565567320/Project%201/Screen_Shot_2019-08-11_at_7.47.45_PM_rojzqh.png
    - I am also proud of how I set up the lets connect section : https://res.cloudinary.com/jeslan/image/upload/v1565567435/Project%201/Screen_Shot_2019-08-11_at_7.49.19_PM_fcd6qs.png


- Add a list of `post-MVP` features that you're waiting to add-on.
    - I would love to add a downward arrow in my intro section to inform the viewer to scroll downward
    - I would also love to add an icon in at the bottom that brings you back up to the top when you click...so you dont have to scroll back up
